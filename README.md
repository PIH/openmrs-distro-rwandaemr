openmrs-distro-rwandaemr
==========================

This project represents the OpenMRS RwandaEMR set of distribution packages as configured for use at IMB.
The intention of this distribution is to mostly inherit from the RwandaEMR distribution parent project
at https://github.com/Rwanda-EMR/openmrs-distro/rwandaemr, but with those modifications that are appropriate for IMB
sites, including functionality like the synchronization module.

[Documentation is in the wiki located here](https://github.com/PIH/openmrs-distro-rwandaemr-imb/wiki).
